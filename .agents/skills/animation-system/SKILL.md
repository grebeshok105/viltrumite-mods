# Animation system (viltrumite-mods)

Read this file before you change or add any animation, pose or visual effect.
The code is the source of truth. If this file and the code disagree, trust the code and update this file.

## 1. Hard rules

1. Do not break current visual effects. Every existing animation, VFX and shader must look the same after your change. Check in `./gradlew runClient`.
2. Use ONLY the systems in this file. Do not add PlayerAnimator, Emotecraft, GeckoLib animation, Veil, a new shader pipeline or any second animation engine. GeckoLib is `compileOnly` for one grab mixin only.
3. Every hero and every active ability MUST have animations: a third-person body pose, a first-person pose, and a visual effect. A hero without animations is not done.
4. Extend the existing classes and patterns. Do not copy a system to make a "better" one.
5. If a new effect needs a capability the system does not have, stop and ask the user before you add it.

## 2. System map

The mod has several layers. Each layer has one job. Pick the layer by what you animate.

| What you animate | Layer | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Player body pose (third person) | `PlayerModel.setupAnim` TAIL mixins | `viltrumitecore/client/mixin/*ModelMixin*`, `viltrumiteflight/client/mixin/SlowFlyingModelMixin`, `PlayerModelMixin` |
| Whole-body lunge/spin/tilt | `PlayerRenderer.setupRotations` TAIL mixins | `*RendererCoreMixin*`, `SlowFlyingRendererMixin` |
| First-person arms/hands | `FirstPersonXMixin` + `PoseDataManager.FP` | `client/mixin/FirstPerson*Mixin`, flight `ItemInHandRendererMixin` |
| Smooth on/off blend of a pose | Weight managers | `client/render/animation/*AnimationManager`, `SilhouetteManager` |
| Animated items and geo entities | Anim core (Blockbench geo + animation JSON) | `viltrumitecore/client/anim/**`, `InfinityGunRenderer` |
| Whole-body replacement (Hulkbuster Mark 48) | `RenderPlayerEvent.Pre` cancel + `RenderArmEvent` (§7.4) | `client/ironman/hulkbuster/HulkbusterRenderer` |
| World effects (rings, beams, sparks, blood) | VFX managers on `RenderLevelStageEvent` | `client/render/vfx/*VFXManager`, `MeltedTunnelRenderer` |
| Screen effects (shake, blur, tint) | Post shader `dash_impact` | `ViltrumiteShaders`, `GameRendererDashMixin`, `shaders/post/dash_impact.json`, `assets/minecraft/shaders/program/dash_impact.*` |
| Flight screen effects | Post shader `sonic_boom` | flight `GameRendererMixin` |
| Overlay on the player model | `RenderLayer` | `AtmosphericHeatFeatureRenderer` via `PlayerFeatureRendererMixin`; hero layers in `ViltrumiteCoreClient.onAddLayers` |
| 3D parts on player parts (helmet, flames, gadgets) | `PlayerGeoLayer` + provider | `client/anim/render/PlayerGeoLayer`, `PlayerBoneMap` (§7.1) |
| Suit skin growing over the body | Baked reveal frames | `client/anim/render/RevealMask`, `client/ironman/IronManSuitTextures` (§7.2) |
| Particles, entity renderers | Forge registration | `ClientModEvents` |
| Hand position for VFX/grab | Tracker mixins | `HandPositionTrackerMixin`, `ChopHandTrackerMixin` |

Ability state comes from synced player data: `ViltrumiteCorePlayer` (core) and `ViltrumiteFlightPlayer` (flight). All visual layers READ this state. They do not own it.

## 3. Player body poses (third person)

Pattern: one mixin per ability on `PlayerModel.setupAnim(LivingEntity;FFFFF)V` at `@At("TAIL")`.

### 3.1 Order (mixin priority)

| Mixin | Priority |
|---|---|
| `DashModelMixin` | 1100 |
| `PunchModelMixin` | 1150 |
| `ChopModelMixin` | 1160 |
| `ChopModelMixin2`, `ThunderclapModelMixin` | 1170 |
| `BarrageModelMixin` | 1175 |
| `HomelanderModelMixin` | 1180 |
| `IronManModelMixin` (hover, glide, heavy-landing kneel) | 1190 |
| `SignatureModelMixin` (Iron Man mark signatures) | 1195 |
| `GrabModelMixin` | 2000 |
| `BlockModelMixin` | 3000 |

A higher priority applies later and wins. Grab and Block lerp from the pose that earlier mixins left. Give a new ability a free priority that fits this order.

### 3.2 Rules for every pose mixin

1. Act only when the entity implements `ViltrumiteCorePlayer` and the ability is active (synced ticks > 0).
2. Skip when `entity == mc.player` and the camera is first person, EXCEPT when `ShaderCompat.isShadowPass()` is true.
3. Write pose constants in degrees. Convert with `Math.toRadians`.
4. Add position offsets to the base pivots:

| Part | X | Y standing | Y sneaking |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arms | ±5 | 2.0 | 5.2 |
| Body | 0 | 0 | 3.2 |
| Head | 0 | 0 | 4.2 |
| Legs | ±1.9 | 12 | 12 |

5. Mirror left/right with `m = isLeft ? -1 : 1` on yaw, roll and X.
6. Before you pose, set `head.zRot`, `body.yRot`, `body.zRot` to 0.
7. After you pose, ALWAYS call `copyFrom` for `hat`, `jacket`, `rightSleeve`, `leftSleeve`, `rightPants`, `leftPants`. If you skip this, the outer skin layer does not move.
8. Null-check `cloak` before you use it.

### 3.3 Timing

- Abilities use a 20-tick countdown. `t = clamp((20 - (ticks - partialTick)) / 20, 0, 1)`.
- Interpolate with piecewise `Mth.lerp`. Overshoot is `×1.15`.
- Standard 2-keyframe timeline (Punch, Chop):

| t | Segment |
|---|---|
| 0–0.25 | vanilla → S1 (wind-up) |
| 0.25–0.35 | S1 → S2×1.15 (strike) |
| 0.35–0.5 | settle → S2 |
| 0.5–0.65 | hold S2 |
| 0.65–0.9 | S2 → vanilla |

- Thunderclap and Barrage have their own timelines. Read their mixins if you need a multi-hit or charge ability.
- Use `Minecraft.getFrameTime()` for partial ticks in new code. (Old mixins mix `getFrameTime()` and `getPartialTick()`. Do not change them.)

### 3.4 Flight poses

`viltrumiteflight` poses run on the same `setupAnim` TAIL.
- `SlowFlyingRendererMixin` (`setupRotations` TAIL) computes `FlightAnimManager.AnimState.deltaSeconds` and body tilt. `SlowFlyingModelMixin` uses that value.
- Per-player state lives in `FlightAnimManager.AnimState`. Add a new factor field there. Move it with `±rate * deltaSeconds`. Blend with smoothstep `x²(3-2x)`.
- GUI frames must not advance state (`deltaSeconds = 0`).
- A core ability that runs in flight must look correct in BOTH grounded and flying states. Chop and Barrage use additive leg blending when grounded. Copy that pattern.

## 4. Whole-body motion

Use a `PlayerRenderer.setupRotations` TAIL mixin (`PunchRendererCoreMixin` 1500, `ChopRendererCoreMixin` 1510, `BarrageRendererCoreMixin` 1515, `ChopRendererCoreMixin2` 1520).
- Translate to a pivot Y, rotate, translate back.
- Lunge curve for strikes: 0 → -0.3 (t 0–0.25) → 1 (–0.35) → hold (–0.65) → 0 (–0.85).
- Existing lunges apply only in flight (`getFlightState() != NONE`).

## 5. First person

- Each ability has a `FirstPersonXMixin` (Barrage, Block, Chop, Chop2, Grab, Gun, Punch, Thunderclap). Read the nearest one before you write a new one. Copy its structure.
- Flight applies `PoseDataManager.FP` in `ItemInHandRendererMixin` and resets arm pivots in `PlayerRendererMixin`. Do not fight these transforms.
- Blocking uses `FirstPersonBlockAnimationManager`, a separate weight manager. A pose that renders in both views needs a separate first-person weight.

## 6. Weight managers

Use one when a pose turns on and off by a boolean (block, grab, gun).
- Copy `GrabAnimationManager`: `static WeakHashMap<LivingEntity, State>`, `calculateWeight(entity, active)`.
- Wall-clock delta, clamped to 0.1 s. `weight = lerp(1 - exp(-k*dt), weight, target)`.
- k ≈ 10 soft fade, 12–15 body pose, 25 snappy weapon pose.
- Call it ONCE per frame per entity per view. The call also advances the state.
- The weight starts at 0 and never reaches exactly 1. Compare with an epsilon.
- Use from the render thread only.

## 7. Anim core (geo items and entities)

Use for Blockbench models: items, projectiles, summons, gadgets. Do not use it for the player body.

Assets:
- `assets/<ns>/geo/**.geo.json` (format `minecraft:geometry`, 1.12.0).
- `assets/<ns>/animations/**.animation.json` (format 1.8.0). Times are in seconds.
- `AnimCache` loads all namespaces on resource reload. Item helpers: `itemGeo(name)`, `itemAnimations(name)`, `itemTexture(name)`.

API:
- `AnimCache.model(loc)` returns null if missing. `AnimCache.animation(loc, name)`.
- `new AnimationController("main").transitionLength(ticks).onEvent(e -> ...)`.
- `play(anim)` does not restart the same name. `restart(anim)` always restarts.
- Per frame, in this order: `controller.play(anim)` → `controller.apply(model, AnimRenderer.time(pt))` → `AnimRenderer.render(..., boneHook)`.
- Stateless timeline form (no start clock, time comes from synced fields): `AnimationController.seek(anim, model, seconds)` resets and poses one clip; `overlay(anim, model, seconds)` poses only the bones the clip animates; `blend(model, a, sa, b, sb, weight)` lerps two clips per bone.
- `BoneHook` runs for every bone, also for hidden bones. Use it to attach effects or vanilla arms.

JSON support:
- `loop`: `true` → LOOP, `"hold_on_last_frame"`, otherwise PLAY_ONCE. Use `hold_on_last_frame` for one-shot actions.
- Keyframes: arrays, numbers, `{pre, post, easing, lerp_mode: "catmullrom"}`.
- Easings: `linear`, `step`, `easeIn/Out/InOut` + `Sine|Quad|Cubic|Quart|Quint|Expo|Circ|Back|Bounce`. Elastic: in and out only.
- Events: `sound_effects`, `particle_effects`, `timeline` → `Event.Type` SOUND, PARTICLE, INSTRUCTION.
- NO Molang. A Molang string becomes the default value and logs a warning. Bake numbers in Blockbench.
- Animation bone names must equal geo bone names. A missing bone is skipped without an error.

Invariants:
- One `BakedGeoModel` instance is shared per resource. Call `apply` directly before `render`.
- Do not keep model or animation references across a resource reload.
- `AnimRenderer.time` is wall clock × 20. It runs during pause.

Template: `InfinityGunRenderer` (BEWLR). It selects `shoot` / `reload` / `idle` from NBT tick timers and hides the `right_arm` / `left_arm` bones to draw vanilla arms in first person.

### 7.1 Geo parts on player parts (`PlayerGeoLayer`)

Approved extension (Iron Man stage 1b): Blockbench geo drawn ON the player
model, following every pose. Use it for armor pieces, flames, gadgets. The
body itself stays the player model with a skin.

- Register once on the client: `PlayerGeoLayer.register(provider)`. Each
  frame `Provider.collect(player, pt, firstPerson, out)` adds
  `Part(geoLocation, passes, pose)`.
- Top-level bone names map to model parts with `PlayerBoneMap`
  (`armorHead/Body/RightArm/LeftArm/RightLeg/LeftLeg`, plain names, GeckoLib
  `armor*Boot` → legs). Children follow. An unknown top bone with cubes is
  skipped with one warning. Write geo in Bedrock armor coordinates (feet at
  y 0, vanilla pivots: arms ±5/22, legs ±1.9/12).
- The layer applies the part's final pose (`translateAndRotate`) after all
  `setupAnim` TAIL mixins, then the bone's own pivot/rotation/scale.
- `pose` runs after `resetBones()` on the shared model: set `scaleX/Y/Z`,
  rotations, `hidden` there (flame length, flicker). Put a child bone pivot at
  the flame root so `scaleY` changes the length.
- Passes: `Pass.cutout(tex)` (lit, `entityCutoutNoCull`) and
  `Pass.glow(tex[, r, g, b])` (`eyes`, full bright, skipped in the shadow
  pass). Glow textures must be black where nothing glows (premultiply alpha).
- First person: `PlayerGeoHandMixin` (`renderHand` TAIL) draws the arm bones
  on the first-person arm (`firstPerson = true` in `collect`).
- Layer registration: `ViltrumiteCoreClient.onAddLayers` (both skins).

### 7.2 Suit skin reveal (baked frames)

Decision record: `docs/spikes/2026-10-ironman-reveal.md`. No custom shader
(Oculus safe).

- `RevealMask` gives every skin texel a distance 0..1 from an origin on the
  body surface; head texels come last. `frame(progress)` → 0..16.
- A client reload listener bakes 16 `DynamicTexture` frames (skin / cut /
  glow / rim) from two skins and a glow map; see `IronManSuitTextures`.
- The `skin` frame is returned by `HeroSkins.Provider.skinVariant`, so the
  model and the first-person arm use it. Glow and rim are an `eyes` layer
  on the parent model with head + hat hidden (`IronManSkinLayer`). A helmet
  is a geo part drawn with the `cut` frame.
- Progress must come from synced timeline fields (`actionElapsed/Length`),
  never from a client counter: relog mid-wave stays correct.

### 7.4 Whole-body replacement (Hulkbuster): allowed only through this renderer pattern

Iron Man stage 5 replaces the whole player body with the Mark 48 model. Only this pattern may do that:

1. Use Forge event hooks, not a model mixin. `RenderPlayerEvent.Pre` draws the big body and cancels the vanilla render while ACTIVE. `RenderArmEvent` draws the two big arms and cancels the vanilla arm in first person. Both are in `client/ironman/hulkbuster/HulkbusterRenderer`.
2. Pose = `AnimationController.blend` (idle or walk, blended by limb swing speed) + `AnimationController.overlay` (one clip for the action). Clip time comes from synced fields (`actionElapsed`, `actionLength`). Loops use wall time. The walk uses walk distance. Never use a client counter for progress.
3. Geo sits in the armor space of §7.1: feet at y 0, JSON x = vanilla x, pixels. Draw it in the entity frame: `mulPose(YP(180 - bodyYaw))`, then `scale(1.7)`. Do not flip. The entity frame already matches the armor space.
4. Cancelling the vanilla render also hides its layers, skin and mark plates. EXITING does not cancel. Tony draws at normal size and steps back. The step is a translation applied in the `RenderPlayerEvent.Pre` stack before vanilla rotates it, so it is in the entity frame.
5. Locked docking parts use the `PlayerGeoLayer.Provider` `HulkbusterDocking` (the armor bones follow every pose). Flying parts draw in the world (`HulkbusterFlight`, `PartFlight`, AFTER_ENTITIES).
6. Glow is a `RenderType.eyes` pass, skipped in the shadow pass. Thruster flames are glow-only: their cutout texels are clear, and the bone scale is zero at rest.
7. `GeoBone.resetToDefault` does not reset `hidden`. A pose that hides bones must set `hidden` every frame.
8. Hitbox and eye height come from the body scale seam (`HeroDefinition.bodyScale`). This renderer does not change them.
9. No pose mixin was added for the Hulkbuster, so the priority table in §3.1 is unchanged.

Art: `tools/assets/make_hulkbuster.py` writes the geo, animation JSON and the 512 px texture pair. Tests: `HulkbusterAssetsParseTest` (parse, bones, clip lengths), `HulkbusterPosesTest`, `HulkbusterAssemblyTest`.

## 8. World VFX

Pattern: a `@EventBusSubscriber(value = Dist.CLIENT, bus = FORGE)` class that renders in `RenderLevelStageEvent` at `AFTER_LEVEL` or `AFTER_PARTICLES`.
- Geometry: `Tesselator`, `QUADS`, `POSITION_COLOR`, position-color shader.
- Usual blend: additive (`SRC_ALPHA, ONE`), cull off, depth test on, `depthMask(false)`.
- Camera space: push the model-view stack, `XP(camXRot)`, `YP(camYRot + 180)`, translate `worldPos - cameraPos`.
- Style: the "paint pixel" ring (`drawPaintPixel`) and billboard crosses. New effects MUST use this pixel style to match the mod.
- ALWAYS restore GL state: `depthMask(true)`, `enableCull`, `defaultBlendFunc`, `disableBlend`, pop the stack.

Two driver types:
- One-shot: static list + `spawnX(pos, ...)` (`BlockVFXManager`, `MeteorImpactVFXManager`).
- State-driven: read synced ticks every frame (`PunchVFXManager`, `ChopSweepVFXManager`), or detect a tick threshold in `ClientTickEvent` (`ThunderclapVFXManager`).

For new effects, age by ticks with partialTick (Thunderclap pattern). Do not use per-frame `age++`: it depends on FPS.

### Regulus pose and world-space helpers

- Use `RegulusAnimationManager.actionTime(entity, snapshot, partialTick)` in both views. It uses client game time and limits extrapolation to six ticks and the action length. Do not use raw snapshot ticks for one view and the shared clock for the other.
- Use `calculateWeight` for third person. Use `calculateFirstPersonWeight` for first person. For a held-book pose, pass the fourth `mainHand` argument so each hand has its own weight. Tick inactive weights too, so they fade out.
- Call `RegulusAnimationManager.reset(entity)` when the hero changes. It clears third-person weights, both first-person hands, and the action clock.
- `RegulusPoseTiming.keyedAngle` recovers to the supplied base rotation. End transient keys at zero. Add head/body offsets to vanilla aim and crouch. Mirror action limbs and yaw/roll for the main arm. Restore position offsets at `setupAnim` HEAD before vanilla uses the model again. Copy hat, jacket, sleeves and pants; do not copy body pivots to the cloak.
- `PixelVfx` emits camera-relative vertices. Call `rotateCamera` once per render pass. Do not translate by the camera again. Use `billboardPixel`, `domeShell` or `sphereShell` for floating points. Shell shimmer changes alpha, not position. Apply owner-only carrier filtering and local first-person aura filtering in the managers, not in the shape helper.

### Shared hero impact FX

- Server code sends impact FX with `hero/fx/HeroFx` (`shards`, `shockwave`, `slam`, `blade`, `launch`, `flash`). It sends `HeroFxS2CPacket`; `client/render/vfx/HeroImpactFx` draws it for every hero. Do not add a hero-specific packet for these shapes.
- Camera shake goes through `client/render/vfx/CameraShake` (`addAt` with distance falloff, `add` for local). Do not add a second shake accumulator.
- Full API list: `.agents/skills/add_hero/references/shared-toolkit.md`.

### 7.3 Mark skins and plates (Iron Man stage 4)

- Whole mark on (all parts present): the body skin is the mark texture
  `textures/entity/hero/ironman_<mark key>.png`. Helmet open uses a baked copy
  with Tony's head (`MarkSkins`, reload listener, 64x64 layout).
- Partial, equipping, exiting, or Mark 42 with lost parts: Tony's skin plus one
  plate per `SuitPart` slice (`geo/ironman/marks/plates/<key>.geo.json`), drawn
  with `PlayerGeoLayer` in both views. Key = bone, from %, to %, side
  (`PlateParts.key`). Generated by `tools/assets/make_ironman_stage4_visuals.py`.
- Plate geo: JSON x = vanilla model x, JSON y = 24 - model y, box UV = vanilla
  `texOffs`. A vertical slice moves the UV origin by its top row. `BakedGeoModel`
  mirrors X, so the rest geo is the body frame at player scale (0.9375).
- Plate pose: `PartWrapAnimator.pose` scales the top-level bone about its own
  centre (the pivot is the slice centre). Clear `resetBones()` before a direct
  draw of a shared plate model.
- Glow: `ironman_<key>_glow.png` as `Pass.glow`. Click flash = an extra glow pass of the skin.

### 8.1 Flying parts and wrap

- Flying parts: `veronica/PartFlightVisuals` (`AFTER_ENTITIES`). Position =
  `PartFlight.position(launch, live anchor, progress)`. The anchor follows the
  moving player's body yaw. Tumble decays to 0, so the part meets the body
  pose exactly. Parts wait in the pod (no draw) until their launch tick.
- Wrap: after the flight, `MarkVisuals.collectParts` draws the same plate on the
  body (`PartWrapAnimator`: open, close, click flash). Locked parts stay as plates.
- Sounds are local clips. `PartFlightVisuals.onClientTick` plays them at the synced launch and lock ticks.

### 8.2 Whole-entity renderers (pod, empty suit, debris)

- `VeronicaPodRenderer`: `veronica_pod.geo.json` with `open`/`close` clips
  (`AnimationController.restart` on each phase change). Doors swing open after landing.
- `EmptySuitRenderer`: shell (mark skin) + interior (`ironman_interior.png`)
  with the 30-tick `open` clip. Body frame: `mulPose(YP(180 - yRot))`, scale 0.9375.
- `SuitDebrisRenderer`: one plate, tumbling, fades and shrinks in the last 20 ticks.
- `MarkVfx`: pixel motes (fire trail, engine flames, sparks, dust ring) and a
  heat aura (`PixelVfx.bodyShell`). Motes age by client ticks and clear on logout.
- Animation sign convention: JSON X and Y are negated like `buildBone`, Z is not.
  Parsed-frame checks: door `rotY` -75 turns the +x door edge toward +z.
  Arm `rotZ` +40 on the +x arm is outward. Head `rotX` +35 tilts the top toward +z. Verify in game.

## 9. Screen effects

Core shader: `viltrumitecore:shaders/post/dash_impact.json`, set in `GameRendererDashMixin` (`renderLevel` TAIL).
Current uniforms: `DashIntensity, PunchIntensity, ShakeIntensity, GrabIntensity, LockIntensity, Time, ChopIntensity, ChopType, ChopIsLeft, BarrageIntensity, BarrageIsLeft, ScourgeIntensity, ScourgeTurn`.

To add a screen effect:
1. Declare the uniform in `program/dash_impact.json` AND in the pass `uniforms` of `post/dash_impact.json`.
2. Clamp it in `dash_impact.fsh`.
3. Add it to the early-out check. If you do not, the effect never shows alone.
4. Colour effects are an exclusive chain: chop > barrage > dash/punch. Put a new one in the chain or as an overlay after it, like lock.
5. Compute the intensity in `GameRendererDashMixin`. Use distance falloff for other players.
6. Do not create a second post chain. Flight `sonic_boom` already replaces other post effects when it loads.

## 10. Recipe: new ability animation

1. Add synced state to `ViltrumiteCorePlayer` (20-tick countdown + side flag if needed).
2. Third-person pose: new `XModelMixin` (sections 3.1–3.3).
3. Whole-body motion if the move needs it: `XRendererCoreMixin` (section 4).
4. First-person pose: `FirstPersonXMixin` (section 5).
5. World effect: state-driven VFX manager (section 8).
6. Screen effect if the hit is heavy: new uniform (section 9).
7. Register every mixin in `viltrumitecore.client.mixins.json`. `defaultRequire` is 1, so a bad target crashes the game.
8. Test in `./gradlew runClient`: third person, first person, grounded, flying, sneaking, left and right side, shaders on (shadow pass). Check that old abilities look the same.

## 11. Known pitfalls

- `PlayerModelMixin` (flight) and `SlowFlyingModelMixin` inject at the same TAIL without priority. Do not depend on their order.
- `ChopRendererCoreMixin` does not check chop type, so it also runs for type 1.
- Many VFX lists are plain `ArrayList` and are not cleared on world change. Touch them only on the render thread.
- `MeteorImpactVFXManager` removes impacts at 600 ms, so its 2500 ms shake window is cut.
- `tickGrab` in `PlayerEntityCoreMixin` was rewritten by hand after decompile and is not confirmed in-game. Compare grab behaviour with the original JAR.
